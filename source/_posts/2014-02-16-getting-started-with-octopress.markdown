This blog has been setup many months ago, but I don't have time to update it. Today I decide to update it. Unfortunately, I run into a problem with run *rake deploy*. It always reject the request to push to master branch.
I've setup the octopress for many times today. Issues still exist:

- How to change git url for the blog
- Make codeblock work when setting language

It may be because I am not familiar with Octopress itself. Hope to find a solution soon.
