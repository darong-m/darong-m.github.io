Steps involved

- Download and install 7-zip.
- Download the Development Kit and install it in say c:\devkit.
- Open a command window and type c:.
- Change folders by typing cd devkit.
- Type ruby dk.rb init to generate the config.yml file to be used later. Your installed Rubies will be listed there (only those installed by a RubyInstaller package are detected at present). This needs to be done only once.
- Finally type, ruby dk.rb install for DevKit enhance your installed Rubies. This needs to be done only once.
- Confirm your Ruby environment is correctly using the DevKit by running: gem install bson_ext --platform=ruby. Itâ€™s crucial that you include the --platform=ruby option to force RubyGems to build the native gem rather than potentially installing an incorrect binary gem.
